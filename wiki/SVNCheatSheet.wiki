This cheat sheet is intended to be brief.  For details, please read the [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ friendly manual].

See also the [Workflow] wiki page and [http://www.mind.ilstu.edu/research/robots/iris4/developers/svntutorial/ this tutorial].

To run commands, right click on the desired file or folder, and use the *TortoiseSVN->* submenu.

==Day-to-Day Use==
  # *Help!  Nothing works at all!*
    * `TortoiseSVN -> Switch...` on the top-level LabVIEW folder to [http://code.google.com/p/coltonlab/source/browse/Magnet/tags one of these] stable tags.
    * This command will _annihilate_ everything inside the LabVIEW folder.  Make sure all changes are `commit`ted before `switch`ing.
  # Sync the latest changes from the Internet.
    * `TortoiseSVN -> Update` on the top-level LabVIEW folder.
  # What was modified and why?
    * `TortoiseSVN -> Show Log...`
  # Pull out a previous revision of a particular file.
    * `TortoiseSVN -> Update to Revision...`, then `Show Log` to find the revision you want.
  # Roll back the entire code tree to a previous date.
    * `TortoiseSVN -> Update to Revision...` on the top-level LabVIEW folder.

==Development==
  # Getting started:
    # Install LabVIEW 8.6 and the [http://joule.ni.com/nidu/cds/view/p/id/1216/lang/en NI-DAQmx 8.9 drivers].
    # Install [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] and/or the command-line SVN client.
    # Install [http://meta-diff.sourceforge.net/ meta-diff suite].  Change string in `lvdiff.vi` from `"T,T,T,T,T,T"` to `"T,T,F,T,F,F"`.  Edit `.lvdiff` to read:
{{{
pathToLV=C:\Program Files\National Instruments\LabVIEW 8.6
pathToLVDiff=C:\Program Files\meta-diff suite
}}}
    # TortoiseSVN -> Settings -> External Programs -> Diff Viewer -> Advanced... and add `C:\Program Files\meta-diff\lvdiff.exe` as a viewer for `.vi` files.
    # Download (Check out) the code from the Internet.  Follow the instructions [http://code.google.com/p/coltonlab/source/checkout here].  Note you need to use your randomly-generated [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/FAQ#Where_do_I_get_a_password_for_committing_to_Subversion? Google Code password].
  # I saved changes to a file by mistake. 
    * If the changes are uncommitted, just `TortoiseSVN->Revert`.
    * If they're already committed, pull out a previous revision as above.
  # What parts of this file did I modify?
    * `TortoiseSVN -> Diff` which invokes `LVdiff` if you have it installed.
    * To see changes for the entire code tree, `TortoiseSVN -> Check for Modifications...` on the top-level folder.
  # Upload (Commit) my changes to the Internet.
    * `TortoiseSVN -> Commit...` and login using your [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/FAQ#Where_do_I_get_a_password_for_committing_to_Subversion? Google Code password].
    * Your changes won't automatically show up on other computers until someone manually `update`s them.
  # Someone else changed a file at the same time as I did.
    * This is called a conflict and happens occasionally. SVN won't let two people commit the same file at the same time.  Try to coordinate with others to tag-team: after your friend is finished and `commit`s his changes, you `update` the file and begin making your changes.
  # I made a new file, but it doesn't get committed. I deleted a file, but it won't go away.
    * Subversion needs to know explicitly which files to track and which to ignore.  Make sure to use `TortoiseSVN -> Add` and `TortoiseSVN -> Delete` to add/delete files from version control.
  # My changes are far-reaching and might break lots of things.
    * Create your own branch, and then you can do whatever you want.  Read the [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.branchmerge.html SVN book] for instructions.
