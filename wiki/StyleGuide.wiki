Good programming habits = fewer bugs.  If we can follow these rules, we can design great software.

[http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html Akin's law]: "Any run-of-the-mill engineer can design something which is elegant. A good engineer designs systems to be efficient. A great engineer designs them to be effective. "

  # Every function should have input coercion.
  # Every function needs a one-sentence description.
  # The comments should state what you mean, not what you did.  In case they disagree,  someone can track down what you meant to do.
  # There is almost always a more concise way to express something.
  # Reduce the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity cyclomatic complexity] of your functions.  No function should ever contain more than four nested code blocks.  If it does, you are doing something wrong.
  # Make functions as generic as possible.  In the absence of templating, use object-oriented interfaces where appropriate.
  # Never, never duplicate code.  There is always a better way than to make twelve duplicate, slightly different, functions.
  # The red dots mean that a type cast has taken place.  Avoid red dots!
  # No magic numbers.  Learn to use enums, or better yet, typedefs.
  # Programmatic simplicity trumps new features.
  # Everybody needs to be a member of a class, with limited access for functions outside the class.  Fewer points of entry = fewer possible bugs.
